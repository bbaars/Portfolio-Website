                <p class="about-me">I am a senior at Grand Valley State University, currently living in Grand Rapids, Michigan. I have a passion for all things technology and creative focused.

                    <br><br> In my free time, I stay busy by teaching myself using books and online tutorials. I have learned HTML5, CSS3, Javscript, jQuery, and a bit of Angular JS. I am no master, but I have gotten to a point where I can easily pick up more about each of these topics.

                    <br><br> Apart from web development, I have learned iOS programming starting at Swift 2, Swift 3, and now Apple's newly released Swift 4.

                    <br><br> I love working with microcontrollers and sensors and being able to understand them on a transistor level, reading / writing registers, and designing circuits to make things work! I hope to get into IoT projects soon during my, not-so-free, free time.

                    <br><br> I'll ocassionally put my projects and tutorials I have done on GitHub! <a href="http://github.com/bbaars" target="new">Check it out.</a>

                    <br><br> Lets build something great together.

                    <p>FilmFo is an iPhone movie database app utilizing <a href="http://www.themoviedb.org" target="new">The Movie Database.</a> It allows the user to view Top Rated Movies, Actors, and TVShows. It has "cross reference" searching allowing the user to search for two or more actors to see a list of movies/tvshows they're in together. It also lets them search for something, and then search for the actor / characters within that media. (Let's say you're watching Game of Thrones and want to know who plays Jon Snow. You just search Game Of Thrones and Jon Snow, and it'll return Kit Harrington.) The app also lets you add a Movie or TV Show to your favorites / watchlist.

                    Researching for me plays a large role in my learning development. With the internet being so easily accessible, it becomes a great platform to view lots of information and to learn new topics. I strive to learn something new each day and some how apply it to a project or to come up with ideas of how I can implement it.

                    I always do as much exploration on subjects as I can. When I want to learn more about UIKit in Swift, I'll read documentation, go to discussion boards, blogs, and read books on the subject. I belive with more knowledge on subjects, I can come up with betters ways of accomplishing the same tasks. With embedded systems, if there is a circuit I have found, I want to understand why it works and how I can use those foundational ideas to build upon in the future.

                    With the technology of today and the tools developers can use, it becomes a lot easier to code and almost instantly see the outcome. Prototyping / Design becomes a lot easier when you can see changes update in real time. It helps with UI & UX, small logic changes, database request, and partial apps to show clients!

                <h3>Swift</h3>
                <p>Even though I started getting familiar with Swift back when Swift first launced, it was always on the back burner of my priority list.
                Since Swift 3 was launched, I have more learned more in-depth skills associated with it. This usually occurs during my off semesters from school.
                There is always more to learn.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>C Programming</h3>
                <p>I started learning C back in 2013. I have used a little bit of it continuously. I feel confident with the security issues associated with C.
                I have also do extensive embedded C programming with microcontrollers.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3>C++ Programming</h3>
                <p>I took an accelerated semester of C++. It was a Data Structures and Algorithms course. It was very insightful into how to create faster, more
                reliable software. C++ is the plusplus of C. The class and data structures were a lot more "easy" to work with. I would like to learn more C++
                for game development!</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Web Development</h3>
                <p>In the Summer of 2016, I was asked to redo my companies website. From there I went home and took online classes on how to build websites from scratch. I have only
                    been doing this for slightly over a year. There is still so much left to learn!</p>
